# Marketing Refactor

## Description

This is a code refactoring project for a hypothetical marketing team named Horiseon. The user story indicated that the project needed to update the codebase so that it conformed to accessibility standards and aided in search engine optimization.

Using the provided HTML and CSS, I refactored the codebase to match the requested criteria and confirmed that it was all functional.
